# GaTSP
* Please refer to the PDF for a detailed explanation of the approach used in the project
* We use Genetic Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.

### Contributions of the project ->
* We propose a modified evolutionary approach to solve the travelling salesman problem, using the
solution obtained from a construction heuristic method

* We propose custom mutation operators and initialisation methods designed for the travelling salesman
problem and compare its performance with some of the standard mutation operators that have
been used in literature to solve the travelling salesman problem

* We analyse the performance of our methodology compared to the standard approaches.

* We attempt to identify which set of parameters would be most suitable to our example of travelling
salesman problem given the amount of accuracy required and the time at hand



### The files explained ->
* bier127.txt = Sample file from the TSPLIB data set collection

* data_cleanser.cpp = Program to read the file bier127.txt (or any other data set file) and output a file "city_coord_data.txt" which contains the coordinates of all the cities in the data set, which is in a format that can be read by the main program

* main.cpp = main file for running GA on the TSP problem with the city coordinates read from the file "city_coord_data.txt". It outputs various txt files containing info about the fiitest chromosome of the generation, fiitest chromosome till now, best fitness of the generation, best fitness till now

* graph_plotter.py = python script that inputs the file "city_coord_data.txt",  "best_chromosome_global.txt", "best_total_distance_global.txt", "best_fitness_global.txt" that are generated by main. It then shows a visualisation in a matplotlib window showing the best path evolving over time.
